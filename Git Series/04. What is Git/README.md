<h1 align='center'>~ What is Git? ~</h1>

<p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.</p>

<p>Git is software that runs locally. Your files and their history are stored on your computer. You can also use online hosts (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) to store a copy of the files and their revision history. Having a centrally located place where you can upload your changes and download changes from others, enable you to collaborate more easily with other developers. Git can automatically merge the changes, so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes without loosing each other’s work!</p>

<h3>Benefits of Git</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Historical Change Tracking</b> – You can review a graph of how your commits have changed over time, see when and by whom changes were made, and revert to a previous commit if needed. This history makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.</li>
  <li><b>Work as a Team</b> – You can easily share your code with teammates for review before you commit or merge back to the main working branch. Additionally, the branching and review capabilities enable simultaneous development. Multiple people can work on the same file and resolve differences later.</li>
  <li><b>Improve Team Speed & Productivity</b> – Git makes it easy for your team to track changes to your code. Now you can focus on writing code instead of spending time tracking and merging different versions across your team. Additionally, Git performs computations and stores your main repository locally, making it quicker on most operations than a centralized VCS.</li>
  <li><b>Availability and Redundancy</b> – Git is a distributed VCS, meaning there is no single, central place where everything is stored. In a distributed system, there are multiple backups in the event that you need one. This approach also means that you can work offline and commit your changes when you’re ready.</li>
  <li><b>Git Is the Industry Standard</b> – Due to its popularity, Git is supported by many integrated development environments (IDEs) and many popular developer tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features of Git</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Free and open source</b> - Git is released under GPL’s (General Public License) open source license. You don’t need to purchase Git. It is absolutely free. And since it is open source, you can modify the source code as per your requirement.</li>
  <li><b>Speed</b> - Since you do not have to connect to any network for performing all operations, it completes all the tasks really fast. Performance tests done by Mozilla showed it was an order of magnitude faster than other version control systems.</li>
  <li><b>Scalable</b> - Git is very scalable. So, if in future , the number of collaborators increase Git can easily handle this change. Though Git represents an entire repository, the data stored on the client’s side is very small as Git compresses all the huge data.</li>
  <li><b>Reliable</b> - Since every contributor has its own local repository, on the events of a system crash, the lost data can be recovered from any of the local repositories. You will always have a backup of all your files.</li>
  <li><b>Economical</b> - In case of CVCS (Centralized Version Control System), the central server needs to be powerful enough to serve requests of the  entire team. For smaller teams, it is not an issue, but as the team size grows, the hardware  limitations of the server can be a performance bottleneck. In case of DVCS (Decentralized Version Control System), developers don’t  interact with the server unless they need to push or pull changes. All the heavy lifting happens on the client side, so the server hardware can be very simple indeed.</li>
  <li><b>Supports non-linear development</b> - Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history.</li>
  <li><b>Easy Branching</b> - Branch management with Git is very simple. It takes only few seconds to create, delete, and merge branches. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase. When a developer wants to start working on something, no matter how big or small, they create a new branch. This ensures that the master branch always contains production-quality code.</li>
</ul>
