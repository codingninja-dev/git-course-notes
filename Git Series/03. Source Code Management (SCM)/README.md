<h1 align='center'>~ Source Code Management (SCM) ~</h1>

<p>In one line Source Code Management or SCM is a software tool used by programmers to manage the source codes.</p>

<h3>Basics of Source Code Management</h3>

<p>Whether you are writing a simple application or a collaborating on a large software development, source control is a vital component of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It allows you to track your code changes and also check the revision history of the code which is used when you need to roll back the changes.</p>
<p>With Source Code Management, you can collaborate with your team or isolate your code and make changes without hampering the changes made by your teammates until the code is ready.</p>
<p>Even the troubleshooting becomes easy as you know who made the changes and what are those changes. Source Code Management helps streamlined the software development process and provided a centralized source for your code.</p>

<h3>Important Features of SCM</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Track Changes</b> – Changes can be tracked as someone making a change leaves a commit message about it</li>
  <li><b>Synchronization</b> – The up-to-date codes can be fetched from the repository</li>
  <li><b>Backup and Restore</b> – Files are saved at any time and restored from the last saved one</li>
  <li><b>Undoing</b> – You can undo both the last known version and the last one created a long time ago</li>
  <li><b>Branching and Merging</b> – Changes are made on a branch and after being approved, they can be merged with the master branch.</li>
  <li><b>Identifying Conflicts and Preventing Overwrites</b> – Overwrites are prevented and in case of conflicts, they are identified. SCM notifies the developers so that they can review these conflicts and resolve them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practice in SCM</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Frequent commits</b> - Commits are snapshots that capture the current state of a project. Frequent commits give many opportunities to go back and undo the work. The commits ban be combined into just a single commit to make clear the log.</li>
  <li><b>Work from latest version</b> - SCM enables to have a local copy of the codebase. To avoid merging conflicts pull or fetch the latest code before updating</li>
  <li><b>Detailed Notes</b> - It is a nice practice to leave descriptive commit log message which will convey the commit’s content. Log messages become a “must” in the course of the project’s development</li>
  <li><b>Review</b> - SCM provides a staging area which is used to collect edits before committing and review changes before creating a snapshot</li>
  <li><b>Branches</b> - This super powerful mechanism allows team members to work on a separate line of development. When branch development is complete it can be merged into the master line</li>
  <li><b>Workflow</b> - SCMs offer form methods of contribution. It is very important that team establishes shared patterns of collaboration. SCM workflows set up processes for merging branches</li>
</ul>

<h3>Popular SCM Tools and Systems</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Git</b> – created by the founder of Linux, Linus Torvalds, Git is a distributed source control system and is relatively new to the industry. It’s fast, efficient, and becoming quite popular.</li>
  <li><b>Subversion</b> – an open source system run by Apache. Also known as “SVN”, it’s one of the most popular source code management tools available.</li>
  <li><b>Mercurial</b> – similar system to Git, and has also been built with performance in mind. It is designed for larger software systems, and is considered easier to use than Git.</li>
</ul>
