<h1 align='center'>~ Git Pull Request ~</h1>

<h3>What is a pull request?</h3>

<p>Pull requests are the way we contribute to group projects or open source projects. For instance, a user forks a repository of Angular and makes changes to that repository. Now the user can make a pull request to Angular, but it’s up to Angular to accept or decline it. It’s like saying, “Angular, would you please pull my changes?”</p>

<h3>What is forking?</h3>

<p>When we love someone’s repository and would like to have it in our GitHub or Bitbucket account, we fork it so that we can work with it separately. When we fork a repository, we get an instance of that entire repository with its whole history. After forking, we can do whatever we want to do without affecting the original version.</p>
